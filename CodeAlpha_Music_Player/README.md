# SUNAssist Aurora Music Player

A modern JavaScript music player with playlists, autoplay, progress bar, and volume control.

## Features

- Glassmorphism UI with aurora background
- Play / Pause / Next / Previous

- Current time and total duration
- Seekable progress bar
- Volume control with dynamic icons

## Audio

For demonstration, the code expects audio files in an `audio/` folder
(e.g. `audio/love1.mp3`, `audio/love2.mp3`, etc.) and covers in `covers/`.

You can place your own `.mp3` files locally and update the `src` paths in
`script.js` if needed. Commercial audio files are **not** included in this repository.
